this is my first application im trying to build and contribue back to the open source commuinty

many pyhton java-script dependent libraries do not make easy to visualze data , instead asking the user to provide the data and write non-pythonic way code in order to get the required chart

my goal is to simplefy that process , and also to intergate this app with the Panel / hooloviews visualization suite
heopefully with guidance from experienced developer i will achieve that goal, and i might start mentoring other new programers so they can contribute too
